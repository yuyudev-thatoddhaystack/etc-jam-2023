-v1.1.0-2.29.24-
* Adjusted text color for anchor and disabled text. Additionally, adjusted anchors so now they are bright when not hovered, and dark with a bright background when hovered. 

* As a side effect, if a ghost is using \f[color,default.anchor], this means it will appear improperly in the balloon. You should probably stick to the original release if that crops up a lot for you.

-v1.0.0-9.23.23-
* Initial release
